# Predicting-Microsoft-Stock-Price-using-Machine-Learning.

## Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting Microsoft's stock prices using machine learning techniques, specifically time series forecasting. Leveraging **TensorFlow**, an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google, I aim to build an end-to-end solution for accurate stock price prediction.

## Objective
The primary objective is to implement a robust machine learning model capable of forecasting Microsoft's stock prices with high accuracy. By utilizing Python libraries for data handling, visualization, and model development, I strive to create a comprehensive prediction framework.

## Libraries Used
* **Pandas**: For efficient data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For fast array computations and mathematical operations.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization and graphical representations.
* **Scikit-learn**: For streamlined data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
* **TensorFlow**: As the core machine learning framework for implementing time series forecasting algorithms.

# Methodology

## Data Handling and Exploration
Python libraries such as Pandas enable seamless handling of the dataset, facilitating both simple and complex analytical tasks. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques are employed to identify trends, patterns, and underlying insights using visual and statistical methods.

## Model Compilation and Training
The model is compiled with essential parameters including optimizer, loss function, and metrics to optimize the cost function using gradient descent, monitor training progress, and evaluate performance on both training and validation datasets.

# Conclusion
By harnessing the power of machine learning and time series forecasting techniques, this project aims to provide valuable insights and accurate predictions for Microsoft's stock prices. Through systematic data analysis, model development, and evaluation, I strive to create a reliable tool for investors and financial analysts to make informed decisions.
